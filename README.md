# emacs-common-denominator
Purpose: make pairing with emacs smoother

Add to your normal emacs init file like this:

```elisp
(push "~/h/emacs-common-denominator" load-path)
(require 'healthfinch-init)
```

I put it at the end of the file so that it will override anything conflicting.

Brickbats to ocho.
